toddhisattva's Surge patches
============================

[Here they are in a zip](patches.zip).

Hook up your levers and knobs!
------------------------------
All (but one) of these patches have all eight of Surge's <a href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/manual/#assignable-controllers">Assignable Controllers</a> hooked up.  If you have enough sliders and/or knobs, hook them up to Surge by right-clicking on each of the Assignable Controllers and choosing "learn controller" then wiggling your control:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="AssignableControllers.png" width="375"  alt="Assignable Controllers" title="Assignable Controllers"/></p>

If you do not have a MIDI controller you can use your mouse to mousenipulate the Assignable Controllers.

Please do not neglect your mod wheel!

I like velocity sensitivity and I hope you do too.

Tactar
------
**Tactar** is a sitar-like sound.  [It sounds like this](happen.mp3).

Talienmachi
--
I was outside and heard a thump.  Turning around, I saw what was obviously an alien machine from outer space; I took it inside.  It had exactly eight knobs.  I was able to model its sounds and tried to translate what the labels near the knobs seemed to imply.  Then it evaporated, leaving a used motor oil scent.

Tarinet
--
**Tarinet** takes the lead vocal in [Color My Surge](Tarinet.mp3).
Maybe it's more of a bass clarinet.

Tawlkpyiana
---
**Tawlkpyiana** is almost exactly the same as **Tawlk**,
but the bell is brighter because it skips F1.

Tbestbrofbraz
---
I approached brass from the FM side.  I approached brass from the subtractive side.
Each side had what the other lacked, a problem easily solved
by [Surge's scenes!](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/manual/#the-scene-concept)
It is the "Best of Both Brass" because of its two sides.

It handles all brass in [Surgerstition](Superstition.mp3).

Tchime
---
Reminiscent of an [FM doorbell chime](Tchime.mp3), but useful for much else besides!

Tefbelmo

More [FM bell sweetness](Tefbelmo.mp3), the knobs can make it different, you gotta twist 'em!

Tefempino
---
An FM piano does it for [Surgerstition](Superstition.mp3).

|**Bright**|Get sunglasses|

I am sorry, I overlooked the mod wheel.  It does nothing.  This will be rectified soon.

Temutu
---
Kinda fonky.  In case you meet a [chameleon man](Temutu.mp3).
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="Temutu.png" width="477" height="69" alt="Temutu" title="Temutu"/></p>

|**Mod Wheel**|Opens filter, squeegies out ears|

Texedbaz
---
If someone leaves the band and you must [cover the part](Texedbaz.mp3).
It's a reconstruction of a patch for [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) and can be twisted to taste (or lack thereof).
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="Texedbaz.png" width="477" height="69" alt="Texedbaz" title="Texedbaz"/></p>

|**Feedback**|Takin' Care of Buzziness|
|**Mix**|Stereo Delay Mix|
|**Crossfeed**|Stereo Delay Crossfeed|
|**Mod Wheel**|Stridency|

Texedbel
---
Another [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) adaptation.  [Much more metallic](Texedbel.mp3) than **Tefbelmo**, maybe more suited to gamelan.  Ever notice, a reference to gamelan always makes you seem musically sophisticated?  You don't even need to know what, or who, it is!
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="Texedbel.png" width="477" height="69" alt="Texedbel" title="Texedbel"/></p>

The knobs are hooked up to the Amplitude and Filter envelope generators.
In this FM patch, the Filter EG drives the FM modulator amounts (which changes timbre).
Set long Amplitude Attack for glass armonica sounds.  You know what to do.

Thindo
---
A very [**sync**ere sound](Thindo.mp3), achieved with wavetable oscillators.

Tokoto
---
A koto that can be a lot of other things, some of them good.  [It makes this sound](Tokoto.mp3).

Torganix

Torganiy

Torganiz

Three organ studies.  This is [**Torganiz**](Torganiz.mp3).
[![Bach](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kuTL-yZnugw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuTL-yZnugw "Little Fugue for Church Organ")
They differ only in the octave assignments of WT Oscs 2 & 3.
**Torganix** has the Oscs in 1:2:3 tuning.
**Torganiy** moves Oscs 2 & 3 up one octave, for 1:4:6 kinda-pipe organy sound.
**Torganiz** moves Oscs 2 & 3 up two octaves, for 1:8:12 epic pipey sound.
