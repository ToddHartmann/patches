toddhisattva's Surge patches
============================
Hook up your levers and knobs!
------------------------------
All (but one) of these patches have all eight of Surge's <a href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/manual/#assignable-controllers">Assignable Controllers</a> hooked up.  If you have enough sliders and/or knobs, hook them up to Surge by right-clicking on each of the Assignable Controllers and choosing "learn controller" then wiggling your control:

I was outside and heard a thump.  Turning around, I saw what was obviously an alien machine from outer space; I took it inside.  It had exactly eight knobs.  I was able to model its sounds and tried to translate what the labels near the knobs seemed to imply.  The less said of it the better.  There is no explanation and no excuse.
